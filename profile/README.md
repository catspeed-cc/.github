# About catspeed.cc
Catspeed.cc is my unofficial organization on GitHub used for development projects. I was working on setting up an invidious instance, and ended up giving up for a while.

Official Catspeed Website: https://catspeed.cc/

# Hosted services:
- Invidious instance (currently down): https://invidious.catspeed.cc/

# Current projects:
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker - A dockerized version of Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge

# Future projects:
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-reforge-docker - A dockerized version of Stable Diffusion WebUI reForge

# Do you or someone you know need dockerization work completed?
If you or anyone you know personally and have connections to requires your project to be dockerized, I will consider doing it for free, depending on the size of the project, and what currently is on my plate. You may contact me by [submitting an issue ticket on this repository](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker/issues)
