# catspeed.cc
catspeed.cc is my unofficial organization on GitHub used for development projects. I was working on setting up an invidious instance, and ended up giving up for a while.

Official Catspeed Website: https://catspeed.cc/

## Hosted services:
- Invidious instance (currently down): https://invidious.catspeed.cc/

## Current projects:
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/releasehelper-menu - A release helper menu for both sd-forge projects below
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker - A dockerized version of lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-reforge-docker - A dockerized version of Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/find-Asus-BMC-IP - A powershell script to find the IP of your Asus BMC/iKVM (for WRX80 boards incl. WRX80E)
- https://github.com/catspeed-cc/torch-my-gpu - A torch stress test for your GPU written in Python

## Need dockerization work completed?
If you or anyone you know personally and have connections to requires your project to be dockerized, I will consider doing it for free, depending on the size of the project, and what currently is on my plate. You may contact me by [submitting an issue ticket on this repository](https://github.com/catspeed-cc/sd-webui-forge-docker/issues)
